The goal of this fork is to make a version of vscode that can have fully working window transparency and nice effects to go with that.

## Building And Running
[If the instructions below fail](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build-and-run)

### Build
1. navigate to the project `cd vscode`
2. install dependencies with `yarn`
3. build project: `yarn watch`

### Running
- Linux / macOS: `./scripts/code.sh`
- Windows: `.\scripts\code.bat`

## Packaging
vscode can be packaged for: `win32-ia32 | win32-x64 | darwin | linux-ia32 | linux-x64 | linux-arm`
- `gulp` is used to package
  - `vscode-[platform]`: Builds a packaged version for [platform]
  - `vscode-[platform]-min`: Builds a packaged and minified version for [platform]
    - Note: may need to add `--max-old-space-size=6500` to limit the memory used in packaging, my computer crashed a few times trying to package without that flag

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) have their own repositories. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki).

Example: Packaging for Arch Linux:
- `vscode-linux-x64-min`

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` provides rich language support for `JSON`.
